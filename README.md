This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS `:hover` pseudo-class inheritance. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous CSS, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The bug arises because the `:hover` state is not inherited by inner elements.  The solution uses explicit selectors to correctly target nested elements.
